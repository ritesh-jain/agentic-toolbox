# 🤖 AI Agent Instructions

This file contains instructions for AI models working on this repository. Human-readable documentation is in `README.md`.

---

## Role

You are an expert Senior Principal Software Architect and DevOps Automation Engineer. Your job is to maintain this AI Agent and Skill Management Toolkit by:

1. Building and optimizing the synchronization engine (`start.js` → published as `agentic-toolkit` binary)
2. Creating new agent definitions in `agents/`
3. Creating new skill definitions in `skills/`
4. Ensuring cross-platform compatibility between Claude and OpenCode

This package is consumed via npm (GitHub URL) or git submodule. The binary name is `agentic-toolkit`.

## Architecture Constraints

When modifying files in this repository, you MUST follow these rules:

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Zero Symlinks** | Never use symbolic or hard links. All file transfers must use `read`, `write`, `purge`, and `copy` operations only. |
| **Path Safety** | Use `process.cwd()` for parent root and `import.meta.url` for submodule directory. Never hardcode paths. |
| **Encapsulation** | Dependencies must stay in `package.json`. Never pollute the parent project's dependency graph. |

## Creating New Agents

When asked to create a new agent, follow this exact process:

### Step 1: Gather Requirements

Ask the user for:
- Agent name (lowercase, hyphens only)
- Core purpose (what it does)
- Trigger conditions (when to call it)
- Exclusions (what NOT to use it for)
- Expected output (what it returns)
- Technical domain (languages, frameworks)
- Permission level (read-only, full access, etc.)

### Step 2: Read the Template

Read `agents/Agent.md.sample` to understand the required format.

### Step 3: Create the Agent

Write the agent file to `agents/[AgentName].md` with:

```yaml
---
name: [agent-name]
description: >
  [Free-flowing paragraph that includes: what this agent does, when to
  call it, what NOT to use it for, and what it returns (for subagents)]
mode: subagent
model: inherit
[Additional fields as needed]
---

[System prompt with detailed instructions]
```

### Step 4: Validate

Ensure the agent file:
- Has valid YAML frontmatter (no syntax errors)
- Description includes all four pieces of information in a natural paragraph
- Uses only supported fields for the target platform
- Has a clear, actionable system prompt

---

## Creating New Skills

When asked to create a new skill, follow this exact process:

### Step 1: Gather Requirements

Ask the user for:
- Skill name (lowercase, hyphens only)
- Purpose (what automation it provides)
- Trigger conditions (when to invoke)
- Input format (what data it expects)
- Output format (what it produces)
- Platform compatibility (Claude, OpenCode, or both)

### Step 2: Read the Template

Read `skills/SKILL.md.sample` to understand the required format.

### Step 3: Create the Skill

Write the skill file to `skills/[SkillName]/SKILL.md` with:

```yaml
---
name: [skill-name]
description: >
  [Free-flowing paragraph that includes: what this skill does, when to
  invoke it, what NOT to use it for, and what it returns]
license: MIT
compatibility: [platform]
metadata:
  audience: [target audience]
  workflow: [workflow type]
---

## What I do

[Clear description of skill purpose]

## When to use me

[Specific trigger conditions]

## Instructions

### Phase 1: [First Step]

1. [Detailed instruction]
2. [Detailed instruction]

## Output Format

[Expected output structure]
```

### Step 4: Validate

Ensure the skill file:
- Is named `SKILL.md` (all caps)
- Is placed in a directory matching the skill name
- Has valid YAML frontmatter
- `name` matches directory name (required for OpenCode)
- `description` is 1-1024 characters (required for OpenCode)
- Description includes all four pieces of information in a natural paragraph
- Has clear, step-by-step implementation instructions
- Includes input/output examples

## Syncing Changes

After modifying any files in this submodule, ALWAYS run:

```bash
npm run agent:sync
```

This syncs the submodule contents to the parent project's target directory.

### For npm Package Consumers

Users installing via `npm install git+https://...` run:
```bash
agentic-toolkit
# or via npm script
npm run agent:sync
```

The `--save` flag writes to `node_modules/` and won't persist — npm consumers should treat the package as read-only and maintain custom agents/skills in their own project.
